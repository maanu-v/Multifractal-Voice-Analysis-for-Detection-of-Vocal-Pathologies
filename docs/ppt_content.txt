Introduction and Motivation
The human voice is produced through a complex interaction of airflow, vocal fold vibration,
and vocal tract movement.
Voice disorders, especially structural and neurological pathologies, disturb this process and
introduce subtle irregularities in speech.
Traditional acoustic features like pitch, jitter, shimmer, and MFCCs capture only short-term
or local changes and often fail to reflect deeper voice irregularities.
Since speech is a nonlinear and multiscale signal, tools like fractal and multifractal analysis
are better suited to describe its complex behavior.
This project explores fractal dimension and multifractal features to better distinguish
healthy voices from different types of voice pathologies.

Problem Definition
Detecting voice disorders from speech is difficult because changes in the voice are often
subtle and complex.
Common acoustic features work well to separate healthy and unhealthy voices, but they
struggle to differentiate between types of disorders, especially structural and neurological
ones.
Structural and neurological voice disorders can sound very similar, which often leads to
incorrect classification.
Most existing methods focus on short-term or linear features and do not fully represent the
nonlinear and multiscale nature of pathological speech.
Therefore, there is a need for a robust and objective approach that can better capture these
complex voice patterns and improve multi-class voice pathology classification.

Gaps Identified
While fractal and multifractal methods have been explored in voice analysis, most studies
focus on either fractal or multifractal features in isolation, rather than studying their
combined contribution alongside classical acoustic features.
Existing works often demonstrate high accuracy, but provide limited analysis of how much
each feature group (acoustic, fractal, multifractal) contributes to performance improvement.
Many multifractal-based studies focus on binary classification or a single pathology type,
with limited emphasis on multi-class differentiation between structural and neurological
disorders.
Although datasets like SVD are widely used, systematic comparisons across baseline, fractal,
and multifractal feature sets on the same dataset are still limited.

Objectives
To analyze voice signals and identify patterns that distinguish healthy, structural, and
neurological voice disorders.
To build a strong baseline system using traditional acoustic features such as pitch, jitter,
shimmer, HNR, and MFCCs.
To extract fractal dimension features that capture the overall complexity of voice signals
across different time scales.
To explore multifractal characteristics of speech using MFDFA and study their contribution
to classification performance.
To compare the effectiveness of classical, fractal, and multifractal feature sets for multiclass voice pathology classification.

Methodology
Dataset Preparation
Speech recordings are taken from the Saarbrücken Voice Database (SVD).
Voices are grouped into three major classes:
Healthy – speakers without diagnosed voice disorders
Structural disorders – conditions affecting the physical structure of the vocal folds
Neurological disorders – conditions affecting neural control of voice production
Sustained vowel /a/ recordings are selected for uniform analysis.
All signals are resampled to 16 kHz, converted to mono, and amplitude-normalized.
Baseline Feature Extraction
Classical acoustic features are extracted to establish a strong baseline:
Fundamental frequency (F0)
Jitter and shimmer
Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR)
MFCCs (mean and standard deviation)
These features capture short-term and perceptual properties of speech.

Methodology
Fractal Dimension (FD) Analysis
Higuchi Fractal Dimension is computed on the time-domain signal to measure overall
waveform complexity.
Wavelet-based multiresolution FD is performed using a 3-level Discrete Wavelet
Transform to capture complexity across frequency bands.
FD features describe long-range and scale-dependent irregularities in voice signals.
Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA)
MFDFA is applied to the steady vowel segment to analyze scale-dependent fluctuations.
Multiple moment orders q are used to capture different fluctuation strengths.
Compact multifractal features are extracted, including:
Singularity spectrum width (Δα)
Generalized Hurst exponents h(q) at selected qqq values
These features represent heterogeneity and nonlinearity in voice dynamics.
[Mid Project Review]

Methodology
Feature Set Construction
Set A: Baseline acoustic features
Set B: Baseline + Fractal Dimension features
Set C: Baseline + Fractal Dimension + Multifractal (MFDFA) features
Classification and Evaluation
The extracted feature sets will later be used to train multiple machine learning models.
Different feature combinations will be tested to study their impact on classification.
Performance will be evaluated using standard metrics such as: Accuracy, Precision,
Recall, F1-score,Confusion matrices
The goal is to analyze the incremental contribution of fractal and multifractal features.

Preliminary Results and Discussion
Baseline acoustic features (F0, jitter, shimmer, HNR) were extracted for all selected voice samples.
Descriptive statistics show systematic differences between healthy, structural, and neurological
voices:
Healthy voices exhibit higher average F0 and lower jitter, indicating more stable phonation.
Pathological voices show higher jitter and lower HNR, reflecting increased vocal irregularity
and noise.
Higuchi Fractal Dimension (FD) analysis reveals consistent trends in signal complexity:
Healthy voices show lower average FD values and smaller variability.
Structural and neurological voices show higher FD values and wider spread, indicating
increased irregularity.
Neurological voices exhibit greater FD variability, consistent with unstable neural control of voice
production.
These observations suggest that fractal features capture complexity information not fully
represented by classical acoustic measures.
[Mid Project Review]

Preliminary Results and Discussion
Multifractal Feature Observations
Multifractal analysis using MFDFA has been implemented for all voice samples.
The singularity spectrum width (Δα) shows noticeable differences across voice
categories:
Healthy voices generally exhibit narrower spectra, indicating more uniform signal
dynamics.
Structural and neurological voices show wider spectra, reflecting higher
heterogeneity and irregular fluctuations.
Generalized Hurst exponents h(q)h(q)h(q) also show class-dependent trends, suggesting
differences in fluctuation behavior at multiple scales.
These results indicate that pathological voices exhibit stronger multifractality compared
to healthy voices.

completed.
Baseline, fractal, and multifractal features exhibit consistent and interpretable patterns across
voice categories.
Fractal and multifractal features capture different aspects of voice signal behavior compared to
traditional acoustic features.
